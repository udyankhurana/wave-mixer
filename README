WAVE MIXER APPLCATION
Made By: Udyan Khurana (201202101)

This application allows us to take 3 input files and for each .wav audio file, we can do:
	- Amplitude Scaling (0-5 units)
	- Time reversal
	- Time scaling (0-8 units) 
	- Time shifting (-1 to 1 sec)

After doing these operations, we can play the resulting file using the 'Play' icon below it, Pause/Resume the file using
the 'Pause' icon and Stop playing using the 'Stop' icon. A progress bar below these buttons will show progress of file.

Also we can select multiple files for Mixing or Modulation using the 'Select for Mixing' and 'Select for Modulation' checkboxes and
then Play/Pause/Stop using options under 'Mix and Play' and 'Modulate and Play'.

Also a 'Record Audio' option is also there. Audio can be recorded using 'Record' icon. When the mic detects silence for a specific 
period of time, the recording stops and you can Play/Pause/Stop the recording using the given options.     
The GUI and AUDIO files are done using PyAudio and PyGTK.
